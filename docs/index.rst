Documentation of GPBoost
========================

**GPBoost** is a software library for combining tree-boosting with Gaussian process and grouped random effects models (aka mixed effects models or latent Gaussian models). It also allows for independently applying tree-boosting as well as Gaussian process and (generalized) linear mixed effects models (LMMs and GLMMs).
