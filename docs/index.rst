Documentation of GPBoost
========================

**LightGBM** is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithms. It is designed to be distributed and efficient with the following advantages:

- Faster training speed and higher efficiency.
- Lower memory usage.
- Better accuracy.
- Support of parallel and GPU learning.
- Capable of handling large-scale data.
