Python Package Examples
=======================

Here are examples on how to use the gpboost Python package. You should install the GPBoost [Python package](https://github.com/fabsig/GPBoost/tree/master/python-package) first. You also need scikit-learn and matplotlib (for plots) to run the examples, but they are not required for the package itself. You can install these packages with pip:

```
pip install scikit-learn matplotlib -U
```

Ideally, you **run the examples in interactive mode in e.g. Spyder or PyCharm**. Alternatively, you can run the examples from the command line in this folder, for example:

```
python boosting_example.py
```

Examples include:

* [Gaussian process and other mixed effects model examples (without boosting)](https://github.com/fabsig/GPBoost/blob/master/examples/python-guide/Gaussian_process_mixed_effects_models_example.py)
* [Boosting functionality (without Gaussian process / random effects)](https://github.com/fabsig/GPBoost/blob/master/examples/python-guide/boosting_example.py)
* [Combining tree-boosting with mixed effects models](https://github.com/fabsig/GPBoost/blob/master/examples/python-guide/combined_boosting_mixed_effects_example.py)
* [GPBoost algorithm with Gaussian process and grouped random effects models](https://github.com/fabsig/GPBoost/blob/master/examples/python-guide/combined_GPBoost_example.py)
* [Cross Validation](https://github.com/fabsig/GPBoost/blob/master/examples/python-guide/cross_validation_example.py)
